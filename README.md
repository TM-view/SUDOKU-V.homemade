<h3> Hello everyone </h3>
    <p>firstly i thanks for visiting this coding beginner
    Secondly will be explain gameplay of my SUDOKU
        1. The number below is the number we will choose to enter in the missing grid
        2. You can click on the numbers to select them (you can tell which number you have selected because it will be blue)
        3. You can highlight numbers that are already in the table by clicking on the numbers in the table and the same numbers will turn green (it is recommended to unselect the numbers before highlighting             them, you can do this by clicking on the numbers again and you will notice that the numbers will change from blue to white).
        4. When the number reaches 9 digits, you will not be able to select that number again (the numbers below will disappear)
    Third(Skip Optional) this is first game that i made maybe bug or some function are missing i apologize
Finally, have fun! </p>
