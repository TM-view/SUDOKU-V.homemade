<h1>Hello everyone</h1>
    <h2>firstly</h2> </p>i thanks for visiting this coding beginner
    <h2>Secondly</h2> </p>will be explain gameplay of my SUDOKU
        </p>1. The number below is the number we will choose to enter in the missing grid
        </p>2. You can click on the numbers to select them (you can tell which number you have selected because it will be blue)
        </p>3. You can highlight numbers that are already in the table by clicking on the numbers in the table and the same numbers 
               </p>will turn green (it is recommended to unselect the numbers before highlighting them, you can do this by clicking on the numbers 
               </p>again and you will notice that the numbers will change from blue to white).
        </p>4. When the number reaches 9 digits, you will not be able to select that number again (the numbers below will disappear)
    <h2>Third(Skip Optional)</h2> </p>this is first game that i made maybe bug or some function are missing i apologize </br>
</h2>Finally, have fun!
